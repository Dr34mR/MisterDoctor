# Mister Doctor Twitch Bot

Mister Doctor is a modular twitch bot built to be extensible with each individual component able to accept a message and reply with a message where desired.

Mister Doctor started off as a single bot (substitution) and grew to encompass other bot functionalities as they became desired.
